# music-maven-plugin

ðŸŽµ Plays some background music while Maven is building.

## Usage

### Basic

The following configuration will play some "elevator" music in the background as soon as Maven starts building:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>software.xdev</groupId>
    <artifactId>music-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <!-- You might also want to add <inherited>false</inherited> so not every child executes this -->
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>validate</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>music</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

### Customizing the music

You can customize the music by adding other sources:

```xml
<configuration>
    <sources>
        <musicSource>
            <uri>https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/mp3-royaltyfree/Corncob.mp3</uri>
        </musicSource>
        <musicSource>
            <!-- Relative to project directory -->
            <file>my_cool_music.mp3</file>
        </musicSource>
        <musicSource>
            <classpath>/default/Andrew_Codeman_-_03_-_Mussels_short_version.ogg</classpath>
        </musicSource>
    </sources>
    <shuffle>true</shuffle>
</configuration>
```

#### Supported codecs

| Codec | Container |
| --- | --- |
| [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) | ``.mp3`` |
| [Vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis) | [``.ogg``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg) |

> [!NOTE]
> Container files can also include different codecs.
> For example ``.ogg`` can also contain ``Opus``, ``Speex``, ``FLAC``, ... which are not supported.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to convert to supported formats you can do so with [``ffmpeg``](https://www.ffmpeg.org/):<br/>
> ``ffmpeg -i music.opus music.ogg``

## Why?
This is obviously a joke/fun plugin.<br/>
You probably shouldn't use it in production or maybe only on April 1st to annoy your colleagues :P

We got the idea during XDEV's christmas party as [rfichtner](https://github.com/rfichtner) always needs more plugins for funnier Maven presentations and was inspired by [this GraalVM issue from joshlong](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/5327).
